## Application of GPD24K
### Food Photograph Triage
![FoodPhotoTriage](https://github.com/Openning07/GPA/blob/master/TeaserOfSA2018.png "With the help of GPD24K, we can now enable AI to pick high-quality food photos automatically!")

When we train a CNN model (*e.g.*, VGG-16 or ResNet-18) on our proposed GPD24 dataset, we can equip AI with the ability to assess the visual aesthetic of food photos, and therefore make it possible to create several practical aesthetic-aware task scenarios in the specific domain of food photographs.

### Enhancement of food photos
